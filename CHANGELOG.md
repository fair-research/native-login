### [0.2.0] - Nov 11, 2020

- ``local_server_code_handler`` and ``secondary_code_handler`` replaced by ``code_handlers`` list
- ``set_app_name()`` removed on code_handlers, replaced by ``set_context()``
- ``LocalServerLoginHandler`` now automatically skips and defaults to ``InputCodeHandler``
  if it detects it is running on a remote server
- Added class level set_browser_enabled(True/False) to set global
  setting for enabling/disabling auto-opening the browser. This can
  be done via: `from fair_research_login import CodeHandler` and
  `CodeHandler.set_browser_enabled(False)`
- Browser is automatically disabled if user enters ^C, to avoid taking control away from them more than once.
- User Keyboard interrupt no longer results in calling sys.exit()
- Keyboard interrupt now causes the current code handler to be 'skipped', and the next one in line used.
  By default, this means ``InputCodeHandler`` will be used if the user enters a KeyboardInterrupt for
  ``LocalServerCodeHandler``
- fair_research_login.exc.AuthFailure raised if no code was retrieved and no ``code_handlers`` remain
