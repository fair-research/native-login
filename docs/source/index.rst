Fair Research Login
===================

Fair Research Login simplifies the Globus Auth Flow to facilitate application
development by providing automatic token management and streamlining the native
app grant process. This is useful for writing re-usable scripts and can be used
as the foundation for new applications without investing significant resources in
authentication code.
